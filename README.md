m.WriteMemory("base+1F46ECC", "int", "999");

you can grab The "base+1F46ECC" by finding the offset for the ammo and double clicking on the address.
"int" Is also another word for 4-Byte which Is the Type for Offset.
"999" Is just a value you are setting the new Memory for Ammo At, You can set It at anything just dont overload It lol.
